My Week 2 homework consist of 2 parts:

Week02O, Lines
https://ual.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=124181b4-1dd9-4859-90ae-afc501287e6c 
Week02O, Lines, is a line-particle system with randomly generated particles of circle with a tail of lines. 

Week02V, Heart

Week02V, Heart, is a particle system consists of red circles that forms a bumping heart.

Week 3

		https://github.com/Pannic17/C2-Week03-Boids 

As Week 3 can be done in group, I cooperated with two of my classmates: Zhou Fang & Yiren Wang. 

With Zhou Fang, Lead Goose
https://ual.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=f47d3cd3-f907-4b52-b243-afc60076e06f 
Lead Goose extract and remodified some of the functions and parameters of Boid class and create a parent class called Creature. Then I create a child class called LeadGoose of Creature that behave differently from Boid. The idea is that boids are the birds that follows the lead goose around the screen. There is only one LeadGoose which follows the click of mouse when user clicks one the screen. To make the boids more adherence to the lead goose, Boid class will auto calculate their distance to the lead goose and apply vector velocity towards the lead goose.


With Yiren Wang, Runaway, Bubbles with Tails
https://ual.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=8761debd-6ad4-4d16-92f9-afc6003c62f3 
Runaway create a scene that fulfills bubbles with tails. The idea is to a child class called BoidLife that record and forms the a tail for the initial Boid. To realize it, the tail particle only have to stay at the position where boid had past and keep the velocity of the boid at that time, basically is the replica of the boid. However, the tail (BoidLife) would have to disappear after certain time and I want to add a size decay for the tail, so that the tail would be more beautiful, which differ their behavior from the Boid class.

Python

For the python riddle, I tried to hide information inside the images using OpenCV library. OpenCV has built-in image hash function, which generates list of image hash in many different types. The hash is binary and can be converted to hexadecimal, so it can be used as coordinates or RGB value. 
I implemented 2 types of hiding information.
hash_hide
Resizes the image to 256x256 pixels.
Hashes the image using MarrHildrethHash.
Converts the hash values to a hexadecimal representation.
Use hash values to generate a list of coordinates represent the pixels to be modified.
Replaces pixels in the image with ASCII characters based on the hash values.
Displays the modified image using the OpenCV imshow function.
hash_glitch
Resizes the image to 256x256 pixels.
Hashes the image using MarrHildrethHash and BlockMeanHash.
Converts the hash values to a hexadecimal representation.
Converts the hash values to RGB values.
Adjusts the y-coordinate of pixels in the image based on the hash values.
Displays the modified image using the OpenCV imshow function.

For the image transformation, I collected a dataset of approximately 600 cat images, then I normalized the image and use Cascade Classifier in OpenCV to process the image, which will detect the cat faces and returns the coordinate of the cat face. Then I use the coordinate to crop the image, thus, I will get a dataset of cat faces. The Cascade Classifier is not so accurate, to avoid faulty result, I filtered the image to abort any cat faces that is smaller than 10x10 pixels, and also enlarge the catâ€™s face a little bit.
